		The student stayed within the 10 minutes limit (~8mins). The student provides a good contextualization of the most general problem (hardpoint games). Furthermore, graphics were used to describe several points of the slides: state machines, the progress so far, and the agile approach. No typos were found.
	
		Despite the aims are clearly stated, objectives (points 1,2) and methodology (points 3,4) are intermingled. While the former generally refers which are the targets of the evaluations and the projects’ requirements, the latter describe how to meet the former (e.g., implementations, technology used, proposed solutions). Still, the aims and problem’s contextualization is very good, and in might also consider additional risks associated to learning approaches. Still, the student should better specify which kind of AI was exploited: (deep) neural networks, Bayesian models, hidden markov models? E.g., RL might be also considered [4], and a context from real world videogames might be also provided [5]
	
		Some final remarks on the referenced literature. For state machines, you can use better literature from [1] or [2], as they come from appropriate compiler theory literature. Still, the assumption on finite state machines is wrong, as it also possible to learn finite state machines from data [3]! Please re-formulate your content accordingly. Still, “let them learn from themselves” from the Forbes is misleading, as they are not computer scientists: this might force into unsupervised learning while, on the other hand, the majority of machine learning techniques that you are referencing are supervised. Still, the student might also consider the following objectives:
		- Assess the effectiveness of training (tradeoff between training time and accuracy of the trained model)
		- Model’s flexibility (time spent training the algorithm vs. coding a good version of the FSM) and accuracy (Please also considered that FSM can be also learned from the data, and not necessarily hardcoded [3])

		The slides had a readable and consistent style with a good content/view balance. The workup plan was sketched (“Plan of Action”), and the develoipment strategy was also discussed (Agile Framework).
